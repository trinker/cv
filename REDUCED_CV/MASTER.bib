  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to revise and validate the
	Individual Child Engagement Record (ICER), an instrument designed
	to observe and measure the engagement of children with disabilities
	in early childhood settings.(1) METHOD: The ICER was revised with
	reference to pilot study results and the literature. Inter-observer
	reliability of the revised measure (ICER-R) was examined by calculating
	levels of agreement between observers coding video-clips of children
	with disabilities engaged in three different activity types (mealtime,
	free play, and structured group time) in an inclusive childcare centre.
	The E-Qual III was used as a criterion measure to examine concurrent
	validity. RESULTS: Good overall percentage agreement and kappa coefficients
	were achieved for the codes recorded. A statistically significant
	correlation was found between data gathered using the ICER-R and
	the E-Qual III when comparing total engaged behaviours. CONCLUSIONS:
	The ICER-R was found to be a vali},
