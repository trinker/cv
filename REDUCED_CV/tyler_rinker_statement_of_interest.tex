%\opening{Dear Mrs. Smith,} 
 
I am writing to express my interest in the call for applications to the AERA Institute on Statistical Analysis for Education Policy: Causal Analysis Using International Data.  My background as a former elementary/middle school educator and current doctoral studies in \href{http://gse.buffalo.edu/programs/cisl}{\emph{Curriculum, Instruction, and the Science of Learning}}, including research and study of statistical techniques tailored for educational analysis, would make me a fit for the institute.  I am excited at the prospect to further develope my skills around educational data analysis and interact with knowledgable experts in the field.
