  abstract = {School children appear to increase their vocabularies by thousands
	of words per year. Many have hypothesized that a large proportion
	of this growth occurs through incidental learning from written context.
	However, experimental research has until now failed to provide unequivocal
	support of this hypothesis. The present study attempted to determine
	whether students do acquire measurable knowledge about unfamiliar
	words while reading natural text. Fifty-seven eighth-grade students
	of average and above average reading ability read either an expository
	or a narrative text about 1,000 words in length. After reading, subjects
	completed two vocabulary assessment tasks on 15 target words from
	each passage (thus serving as controls for the passage not read),
	an individual interview and a multiple-choice test, both designed
	to tap partial knowledge of word meanings. Results of within-subject,
	hierarchical regression analyses showed small but statistically reliable
	gains in word knowledge from context. Tentative extrapolations from
	the results and current estimates of the volume of children's reading
	lead us to believe that incidental learning from context accounts
	for a substantial proportion of the vocabulary growth that occurs
	during the school years. /// [French] Les écoliers semblent augmenter
	leur vocabulaire de milliers de mots par an. Nombreux sont ceux qui
	ont pour hypothèse qu'une large proportion de cette croissance intervient
	grâce à une acquisition accidentelle à partir d'un contexte écrit.
	Cependant, la recherche expérimentale n'a pas pu jusqu'à présent
	fournir un soutient univoque à cette hypothèse. L'étude présente
	essaie de déterminer si les élèves acquièrent en fait des connaissances
	mesurables sur les mots qui ne leur sont pas familiers au cours de
	la lecture de textes naturels. Cinquantesept élèves de quatrième
	à compétence de lecture moyenne et au-dessus de la moyenne ont lu
	un texte d'exposition ou de narration d'environ 1000 mots. Après
	la lecture, les sujets ont complété deux tâches d'évaluation de vocabulaire
	sur 15 mots cibles à partir de chaque passage (servant ainsi de contrôles
	pour le passage non lu), un entretien individuel et un test à choix
	multipes, désignés à aborder la connaissance partielle des significations
	de mots. Les résultats des analyses de régression hiérarchique de
	sujet unique ont montré des gains moindres mais statistiquement sûrs
	en connaissance de mots à partir d'un contexte. Des extrapolations
	d'essai à partir des résultats et des calculs courants du volume
	de lecture chez les enfants nous ont menés à croire que la lecture
	accidentelle à partir d'un contexte compte pour une proportion substantielle
	de la croissance du vocabulaire qui a lieu au cours des années scolaires.
	/// [Spanish] Al parecer, alumnos incrementan su vocabulario con
	miles de palabras cada año. Muchos han avanzado la hipótesis que
	una gran proporción de este incremento ocurre por medio de aprendizaje
	incidental del contexto escrito. No obstante, investigación experimental
	no ha provisto evidencia irrefutable para esta hipótesis. Este estudio
	trató de determinar si los alumnos adquieren conocimiento medible
	de palabras desconocidas durante la lectura de textos normales. Cincuenta
	y siete alumnos de octavo grado, de habilidad normal y superior en
	lectura, leyeron un texto descriptivo o narrativo, de approximadamente
	1000 palabras. Después de la lectura, los alumnos completaron 2 actividades
	de evaluación de vocabulario sobre 15 palabras específicas de cada
	pasaje (sirviendo así como control de los pasajes no leídos), una
	entrevista individual y un test de elección múltiple, ambos diseñados
	para descubrir conocimiento parcial de significado de palabras. Los
	resultados por individuo, utilizando análisis de jerarquía de regresión,
	mostraron pequeño pero estadísticamente fiable progreso en el conocimiento
	de palabras por medio de contexto. Extrapolaciones tentativas de
	los resultados y cálculos presentes del volumen de lectura de alumnos,
	nos llevan a deducir que aprendizaje incidental del contexto da cuenta
	de una proporción considerable del incremento de vocabulario que
	ocurre durante los años escolares.},

	revealed several generalizations. For example, existential proofs
	comparing good and poor readers or older and younger readers established
	that several behaviors related to strategy use and monitoring discriminate
	between mature and novice or good and poor readers. On the other
	hand, existential descriptions of classroom practices and manual
	suggestions revealed little explicit teaching of either comprehension
	or comprehension monitoring strategies. The studies also indicated
	one model of instruction that emphasized guided practice, independent
	practice, and feedback. Using this model, teachers can train students
	to summarize an expository passage, ask questions about it, detect
	difficult portions, and make predictions about following passages,
	eventually assuming responsibility for monitoring these tasks themselves.

  abstract = {{The Grammar of Graphics , or GOG, denotes a system with seven orthogonal
	components. By orthogonal , we mean there are seven graphical component
	sets whose elements are aspects of the general system and that every
	combination of aspects in the product of all these sets is meaningful.
	This sense of the word orthogonality, a term used by computer designers
	to describe a combinatoric system of components or building blocks,
	is in some sense similar to the orthogonal factorial analysis of
	variance (ANOVA), where factors have levels and all possible combinations
	of levels exist in the ANOVA design. If we interpret each combination
	of features in a GOG system as a point in a network, then the world
	described by GOG is represented in a seven-dimensional rectangular
	lattice.}},
